This library aims to provide a simple and elegant approach to writing network requests. It's designed to be lightweight, adding a thin layer on top of `URLSession` without excessive engineering overhead. 

#### Our primary objectives are:

- **Lightweight networking library:** Keep the library small and efficient.
- **Easy to maintain:** Prioritize clear code and modular design for maintainability.
- **Beginner friendly:** Make the library accessible to developers of all levels.
- **Well documented:** Provide comprehensive documentation to guide usage.
- **Customizable and testable:** Allow for flexibility and ensure code quality through testing.


Currently, this library supports basic HTTP data requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and includes a small file upload feature using `multipart/form-data`. These capabilities address the majority of network communication needs in most applications.
