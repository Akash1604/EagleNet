This library aims to provide a simple and elegant approach to writing network requests. It's designed to be lightweight, adding a thin layer on top of `URLSession` without excessive engineering overhead. 

#### Our primary objectives are:

- **Lightweight networking library:** Keep the library small and efficient.
- **Easy to maintain:** Prioritize clear code and modular design for maintainability.
- **Beginner friendly:** Make the library accessible to developers of all levels.
- **Well documented:** Provide comprehensive documentation to guide usage.
- **Customizable and testable:** Allow for flexibility and ensure code quality through testing.


Currently, this library supports basic HTTP data requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and includes a small file upload feature using `multipart/form-data`. These capabilities address the majority of network communication needs in most applications.<br><br>

EagleNet is available through [SPM](https://github.com/AnbalaganD/EagleNet). Use the URL below to add it as a dependency.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AnbalaganD/EagleNet", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.10"))
]
```

### Making a GET Request

```swift
import EagleNet

struct User: Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

// Basic GET request
let user: User = try await EagleNet.get(
    url: "https://api.example.com/users/1"
)
```

### Making a POST Request

```swift
struct CreateUser: Encodable {
    let name: String
    let email: String
}

struct UserResponse: Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
}

let newUser = CreateUser(name: "Anbalagan D", email: "anbu94p@gmail.com")
let response: UserResponse = try await EagleNet.post(
    url: "https://api.example.com/users",
    body: newUser
)
```

### File Upload

```swift
let imageData = // ... your image data ...
let response: UploadResponse = try await EagleNet.upload(
    url: "https://api.example.com/upload",
    parameters: [
        .file(
            key: "avatar",
            fileName: "profile.jpg",
            data: imageData,
            mimeType: .jpegImage
        ),
        .text(key: "username", value: "Anbu")
    ],
    progress: { bytesTransferred, totalBytes in
        let progress = Float(bytesTransferred) / Float(totalBytes)
        print("Upload progress: \(Int(progress * 100))%")
    }
)
```

### Request Interceptors

```swift
struct AuthInterceptor: RequestInterceptor {
    let token: String
    
    func modify(request: URLRequest) async throws -> URLRequest {
        var modifiedRequest = request
        modifiedRequest.addValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
        return modifiedRequest
    }
}

// Add interceptor to network service
EagleNet.addRequestInterceptor(
    AuthInterceptor(token: "your-auth-token")
)
```

### Response Interceptors
```swift
struct LoggingInterceptor: ResponseInterceptor {
    func modify(data: Data, urlResponse: URLResponse) async throws -> (Data, URLResponse) {
        if let httpResponse = urlResponse as? HTTPURLResponse {
            print("Response Status Code: \(httpResponse.statusCode)")
            print("Response Headers: \(httpResponse.allHeaderFields)")
            
            if let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
                print("Response Body: \(responseString)")
            }
        }
        return (data, urlResponse)
    }
}

// Add response interceptor to network service
EagleNet.addResponseInterceptor(LoggingInterceptor())
```
